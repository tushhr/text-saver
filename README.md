# Text Saver - Extension

An extension to save all your highlighted text in one place! 

## Why?

- Imagine you read a lot. And there's always this feeling to "save" some quotes, or some lines which hit you, or whatever the reason is.
- What do you typically do? 
- If you are anywhere like me, Copy the text, open that huge .txt file you have been maintaining for a long time and paste the content, then the URL (if required)
- But I don't like this, it distracts me from my reading, breaks the "flow"
- But not anymore!

## How it works?
- Just select the text, click on the right button, select `Save Selected Text` and tada!
- That's it!
- All your highlighted text is in one place. To access easily click the extension icon on the extension icons, it will redirect you to the page with all your saved texts.
- No Login required. No Payment. It's completely free!
- Clicking on the link, will also redirect to the page and "highlight" the selected text. Isn't that amazing?
